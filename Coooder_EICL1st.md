# Coooder
I'm Coooder, a junior Web3 frontend engineer. My lab is working on DID and Blockchain. I am applying for this co-learning because I'm poor in English speaking and listening. Wish to improve with friends same with me.

## Notes

#### writing
I have finished the article (https://github.com/yujiangshui/A-Programmers-Guide-to-English),which give me a deeper understanding about English learning. 
As a student born in small village, I am good at reading English exam paper and featuring out the right decision among ABCD. 
But I'm poor in listening and speaking, meanwhile, have a negative mood when facing a website full English. This make a huge difficult in front of my coding and studying life.
I decided to keep learning English with the method in this article. Beside the dictation, I'll try to write something every day and use GPT to find my mistakes.
Let's go intensive co-learning!!!

#### re-writing with GPT
I have finished the article (https://github.com/yujiangshui/A-Programmers-Guide-to-English),which give me a deeper understanding about English learning.
As a student born in a small village, I am good at reading English exam papers and selecting the right answer among the multiple choices (ABCD).
However, I struggle with listening and speaking. Meanwhile, I feel discouraged when facing a website entirely in English. This poses a significant challenge in my coding and academic pursuits.
I have decided to continue learning English using the methods suggested in the article. In addition to dictation, I will try to write something every day and use GPT to identify my mistakes.
Let's embark on this intensive co-learning journey together!

### 2024.6.25

#### writing
I have finished the grammar share on the website (https://hzpt-inet-club.github.io/english-note/). The grammar knowledge is not difficult for me, but it's quite interesting to learn English through a colorful website.
Today's English learning time is not long, on the one hand, I'm familiar with English grammar, on the other hand, I got a task from my lab which need to handle quickly.
Tomorrow I'll begin to do some English diction. Wish a good luck!

听写笔记的方法和演示，以 https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1U7411a7xG 为例，仅参考：

1. 不看字幕，听写发音内容，不会的没关系，尽量写即可
2. 反复听几遍，然后继续把内容进行完善，直到无法继续写出来

Mother terisa, who received a noble pice prize from her work on behalf of the pool of india 87 years old.

反复几遍直到听不出：Mother terisa, who received a Noble Pace Prize from her work on behalf of poor and dies of dia cacke in India, she was 87 years old.

3. 到第二天或者查看答案，进行对比和完善总结，把不会的单词进行记录，跟读句子进行训练。

第二节答案：Mother Teresa, who received a Nobel Peace Prize for her work on behalf of the poor, dies in Calcutta India. She was 87 years old.

笔记：

- Teresa：人名，死记硬背
- Nobel Peace Prize：诺贝尔和平奖。Pace 的发音跟 Peace 有区别，Pace 是步伐、速度的意思。
- Calcutta：加尔各答，死记硬背
