#### re-writing with GPT
I have finished the article (https://github.com/yujiangshui/A-Programmers-Guide-to-English),which give me a deeper understanding about English learning.
As a student born in a small village, I am good at reading English exam papers and selecting the right answer among the multiple choices (ABCD).
However, I struggle with listening and speaking. Meanwhile, I feel discouraged when facing a website entirely in English. This poses a significant challenge in my coding and academic pursuits.
I have decided to continue learning English using the methods suggested in the article. In addition to dictation, I will try to write something every day and use GPT to identify my mistakes.
Let's embark on this intensive co-learning journey together!

#### writing
I have finished the grammar share on the website (https://hzpt-inet-club.github.io/english-note/). The grammar knowledge is not difficult for me, but it's quite interesting to learn English through a colorful website.
Today's English learning time is not long, on the one hand, I'm familiar with English grammar, on the other hand, I got a task from my lab which need to handle quickly.
Tomorrow I'll begin to do some English diction. Wish a good luck!

听写笔记的方法和演示，以 https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1U7411a7xG 为例，仅参考：

1. 不看字幕，听写发音内容，不会的没关系，尽量写即可
2. 反复听几遍，然后继续把内容进行完善，直到无法继续写出来

Mother terisa, who received a noble pice prize from her work on behalf of the pool of india 87 years old.

反复几遍直到听不出：Mother terisa, who received a Noble Pace Prize from her work on behalf of poor and dies of dia cacke in India, she was 87 years old.

3. 到第二天或者查看答案，进行对比和完善总结，把不会的单词进行记录，跟读句子进行训练。

第二节答案：Mother Teresa, who received a Nobel Peace Prize for her work on behalf of the poor, dies in Calcutta India. She was 87 years old.

笔记：

- Teresa：人名，死记硬背
- Nobel Peace Prize：诺贝尔和平奖。Pace 的发音跟 Peace 有区别，Pace 是步伐、速度的意思。
- Calcutta：加尔各答，死记硬背
