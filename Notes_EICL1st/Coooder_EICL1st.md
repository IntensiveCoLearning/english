#### re-writing with GPT
I have finished the article (https://github.com/yujiangshui/A-Programmers-Guide-to-English),which give me a deeper understanding about English learning.
As a student born in a small village, I am good at reading English exam papers and selecting the right answer among the multiple choices (ABCD).
However, I struggle with listening and speaking. Meanwhile, I feel discouraged when facing a website entirely in English. This poses a significant challenge in my coding and academic pursuits.
I have decided to continue learning English using the methods suggested in the article. In addition to dictation, I will try to write something every day and use GPT to identify my mistakes.
Let's embark on this intensive co-learning journey together!

### 2024.6.25

#### writing
I have finished the grammar share on the website (https://hzpt-inet-club.github.io/english-note/). The grammar knowledge is not difficult for me, but it's quite interesting to learn English through a colorful website.
Today's English learning time is not long, on the one hand, I'm familiar with English grammar, on the other hand, I got a task from my lab which need to handle quickly.
Tomorrow I'll begin to do some English diction. Wish a good luck!
