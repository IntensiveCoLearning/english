# Derick

- I'm Derick,a software engineer. I want to improve my English to communicate with others more fluently. 
- I have tried many ways to learn English, but the results are not good so far. On the one hand, I have not invested enough time, and on the other hand, I cannot measure my learning results. Whether to take the language level test as the goal or to be able to read the translation as the goal, now basically reading technical documents is good, but listening and writing are poor

- The daily habit of recording new vocabulary and grammar points is crucial for my progress. I'm now able to comprehend content that was previously beyond my grasp, a testament to my growth.
## Do you think you will finish the whole CoLearning program?
- Maybe 90 %

## Notes
### 2024.6.24
- In this 21-day co-learning plan, I aim to significantly enhance my English proficiency. My daily routine will involve thorough grammar review, journaling in English, and utilizing GPT to refine my grammatical accuracy. Additionally, I will employ a browser extension to capture new vocabulary encountered in my reading materials and maintain a daily vocabulary log.

- Considering my current level of English, I dedicate at least 2-3 hours per day to language learning. By the end of this program, I anticipate achieving notable progress in my listening, speaking, reading, and writing abilities.

- My guiding principle for this journey is: "No self-deception."

### 2024.6.25
- Dedicating two hours to grammar lessons today, I'm now able to construct basic sentences. I also delved into three technical articles, enhancing my comprehension by reading aloud twice from "[Learning English: Tips and Tricks for A1 Beginners](https://blog.ithuo.net/posts/english-comprehension-made-easy-begin/)". Further practice is undoubtedly required.

- Basking in the glorious sunshine today, I'm greeted by a panorama of cerulean skies and fluffy white clouds. I adore such weather, even with the hint of warmth. Last night's missed bedtime resulted in a later wake-up this morning, but I'm determined to hit the sack early tonight. Tomorrow, I'll be up at 8:30 AM, ready to immerse myself in my English learning journey. I have unwavering faith in my ability to master the language and wield it as a tool for communication.

- Addressing my excessive screen time, particularly on social media, is a pressing matter. I'm aware that these mindless scrolls are both futile and draining, yet I find myself mindlessly swiping through them. This behavior is detrimental, and I'm taking a firm stance to limit my daily screen time to two hours or less.

### 2024.6.26
- Today's English learning focused on culinary expressions. I delved into an article titled "[Learning English: Food Vocabulary and Culture for A1 Beginners](https://blog.ithuo.net/posts/learning-english-food-vocabulary-culture-a1-beginners/)", reading it twice and reviewing some grammar. I also indulged in a mental feast by imagining my most desired dishes. While I'm not a culinary maestro, I relish the opportunity to explore the world of gastronomy with my partner. Not too long ago, we embarked on a culinary adventure to Wuxi, savoring the local cuisine, which was an absolute delight.

- My daily quest for effective English learning continues, driven by the desire to unlock the fastest path to fluency. However, I've come to realize that mastering a language is a marathon, not a sprint. While others can grasp concepts in a day, I often require three. Yet, perseverance is my guiding principle, and I'm committed to expanding my English vocabulary and expression.

### 2024.6.27
- Today's English learning journey was a blend of grammar review and vocabulary expansion. I revisited the basics of English grammar, focusing on sentence structure and verb tenses. Additionally, I explored the nuances of culinary vocabulary, delving into the lexicon of food and cooking techniques. My daily routine now includes a dedicated vocabulary log, where I record new words and their definitions. This practice has proven invaluable in expanding my linguistic repertoire and enhancing my comprehension of English texts.

- As I navigate the intricacies of the English language, [Learning English: Weather Vocabulary for A1 Beginners](https://blog.ithuo.net/posts/learning-english-weather-vocabulary-a1-beginners/) I'm reminded of the importance of consistency and dedication. Language acquisition is a gradual process, requiring patience and perseverance. While I may encounter challenges along the way, I remain steadfast in my commitment to mastering English and achieving fluency. With each passing day, I grow more confident in my ability to communicate effectively and express myself eloquently in this beautiful language.

### 2024.6.28

- Today's task is to learn about pet expressions. The practice article is [Learning English: Pet Vocabulary for A1 Beginners](https://blog.ithuo.net/posts/learning-english-pet-vocabulary-a1-beginners/). I recently got a pet turtle, a Brazilian tortoise named Baxi. We keep it in a tank with rocks and sand. It always tries to escape at night, and I can hear it scurrying around in the tank every evening.

- In the winter, we noticed it didn't eat much and the weather was cold, so we thought it was entering hibernation and moved it under our bed. When we opened it up in the spring, we found it had died. We were very sad.

- We found this turtle on a rainy day and fed it every day. It loves to eat meat and sometimes opens its mouth wide. We all loved it very much.

### 2024.6.29
####  Today's English Lesson: New Year's Resolutions

- Today's English lesson focuses on vocabulary related to New Year's resolutions. I'm using this article from [Derick's website (ithuo.net)](https://blog.ithuo.net/posts/learning-english-new-years-resolutions-vocabulary-a1-beginners/) as practice material. Speaking of New Year's resolutions, I wonder if I can achieve mine this year. They are:

1. To be able to converse in English with native speakers.

2. To travel to an English-speaking country independently.

3. To use English to secure remote work opportunities in other countries.

- While I'm confident in my technical skills, my English proficiency still needs improvement. I know it won't happen overnight, but I hope to make significant progress in the next two months.

#### Summer Heat and Unexpected Water Shortage

- The weather today has been sweltering. After waking up from my afternoon nap, I was ready for a refreshing shower, only to discover that the water was out. This is a frequent occurrence in our neighborhood, and I'm not sure why. It's not even the rainy season yet, so maybe they're repairing the drainage pipes. Life becomes quite inconvenient without water. Now I truly appreciate the importance of water, electricity, and gas to our daily lives.



### 2024.6.30
- 请假一天
### 2024.7.1
- Yesterday, exhausted from the day's activities, I returned home around 8:00 PM and immediately went through my bedtime routine. My intention to study English was quickly replaced by the need for rest, and I drifted off to sleep.

- Awakening at 3:00 AM due to an early bedtime, I felt a slight discomfort in my stomach. To distract myself, I reached for my phone, scrolling through its contents until drowsiness overcame me around 5:00 AM. This early morning slumber extended until 11:00 AM, causing me to miss out on a precious portion of the morning.

- Today's English learning topic focused on how to describe one's daily routine, using the resource "[Learning English: Daily Routine Vocabulary for A1 Beginners](https://blog.ithuo.net/posts/learning-english-daily-routine-vocabulary-a1-beginners/)". While I believe I have attained an A1 level of proficiency, I recognize the importance of continued practice and dedication. Additionally, I plan to explore promising Web3 projects, seeking inspiration from their innovative concepts.


### 2024.7.2
- I was so relieved when it finally rained today, as the scorching heat finally subsided. I decided to stay in, enjoying the pitter-patter of raindrops outside while feeling a sense of tranquility wash over me.

- My language learning session for the day consisted of revisiting "[Learning English: Home and Housing Vocabulary for A1 Beginners](https://blog.ithuo.net/posts/learning-english-home-housing-vocabulary-a1-beginners/)" three times, followed by listening practice until 4 pm. Feeling drowsy, I took an hour-long nap. Upon waking up, I was thrilled to receive my rent refund. To celebrate, my girlfriend and I decided to indulge in an all-you-can-eat barbecue feast.

### 2024.7.3
- Today is overcast, with a cool breeze coming through the window. I'm really enjoying this kind of summer weather. Hebei province hasn't seen rain in ages and could really use a good downpour. Meanwhile, the south is dealing with flooding. I hope they can recover quickly.

- I've been practicing my English by reading aloud from an [article about job and work vocabulary for beginners](https://blog.ithuo.net/posts/learning-english-job-work-vocabulary-a1-beginners/). It's interesting to learn about the author's work experiences and how their job has impacted them. I'm also learning English for work purposes, and I'm hoping to get more positive reinforcement from my studies. While I can now understand technical articles, I still struggle with direct communication and need more practice with everyday conversation.

- I discussed automating some processes for our collaborative learning project with Muxin. My next task is to develop a script that will help reduce conflicts when others submit their assignments. This will be my first contribution to LXDAO, and I'm excited to be involved in such a project.

### 2024.7.4
- Today's primary task was to develop an automated script that can automatically check our submitted assignments and update the submission status in the readme file. I'm thrilled to have finally submitted it for testing. Writing this tool in Python will significantly reduce errors and provide convenience for participants.

- The article I studied today was "[Learning English: Transportation Vocabulary for A1 Beginners](https://blog.ithuo.net/posts/learning-english-transportation-vocabulary-a1-beginners/)". It introduces various means of transportation. I don't drive and always take public transportation, which reduces carbon emissions, protects the environment, and avoids traffic jams. However, I've been considering buying a car lately, as owning a vehicle expands one's travel radius. Unlike high-speed trains and airplanes, cars are primarily used for short distances within 200 kilometers and allow for spontaneous trips without waiting for schedules.

- It's another overcast day today, but it's pleasantly cool without rain. I enjoy this kind of weather.

- Time flies. It's hard to believe I've been working from home for almost a year. I'm disappointed that I haven't completed my plans.



### 2024.7.5

#### Today's English Lesson: Fascinating Facts for A1 Beginners

- [Today's English lesson delves](https://blog.ithuo.net/posts/learning-english-facts-about-english-language-a1-beginners/) into the fascinating origins of the English language and its composition. It reveals that English has absorbed 30% of its vocabulary from French, Latin, and other languages, making it the most widely spoken language globally. Even the latest artificial intelligence large language models are heavily trained on English data. Another advantage of learning English is that it opens up a world of communication with people from diverse backgrounds, as it serves as a common language for many.

#### A Dampened Barbecue Experience

- Last night, we went for a barbecue, but the experience turned out to be a bit disappointing due to a sudden downpour. We narrowly escaped getting drenched, but the food didn't quite live up to our expectations. The prices were also on the higher side, and the location wasn't the most convenient. These factors make us hesitant to return for a second visit. Despite its size and numerous barbecue stalls, this particular spot doesn't seem to offer the best overall experience. It's a shame, as it could be a great way to promote local consumption in our small town.

#### Refreshing Rain-Kissed Air

- After the downpour, the air transformed into a refreshing haven. I always cherish the post-rain atmosphere, filled with a blend of earthy and grassy scents. Taking a deep breath of this revitalizing air feels like a soothing balm for the soul.

### 2024.7.6

- Today, I spent the entire day debugging a script for automating the update of learning status. After writing for an afternoon, I felt exhausted, constantly being interrupted by time zone issues. Initially, I wanted to use the simplest approach, considering the time difference of only a few hours. I planned to set an effective time frame and exclude the sleep hours of both time zones, allowing for submission. However, our goal was real-time updates. After all, New Zealand is four hours ahead of China. To achieve real-time calculations, retrieving commit timestamps from GitHub proved cumbersome and unreliable. Finally, I decided to implement a time zone parameter, allowing user control. Users in different time zones can input their respective time zones, enabling the system to calculate UTC time plus the user's time zone and determine whether the learning session has been completed. While there's still room for optimization, the script is now functional, and I feel a sense of accomplishment.

- Today, I listened to an [A1 beginner's English lesson on supermarket vocabulary from Derick's website](https://blog.ithuo.net/posts/learning-english-supermarket-vocabulary-a1-beginners/). While I didn't have the time for reading aloud, I read the text several times and grasped the overall meaning. I need to dedicate more time to English learning. I should prioritize English over other subjects.
