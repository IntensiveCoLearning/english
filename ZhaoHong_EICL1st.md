在一个简单的句子里只有一个生词的时候，虽然不认识但是可以根据读音猜出来。
但是当不熟悉的词比较多，句子结构又比较复杂的时候，就有点困难了。
准备使用《新概念III》来作为词汇和语法的补充。
找了两个学习资料：
- [视频教程](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5YAbMpT3Nh0-CzUxXCc79WTHXBwuZ8PN) 外研社的原版教程，虽然有些年头了，但是看起来还是比较舒服的（相比之下新东方在线的课程就太冗长太啰嗦了
- [学习笔记](https://www.ha85.com/books/3) 作为补充，看一下这个学习笔记也是不错的。

另外看了一下教练的网站提供的[课程](https://letsmasterenglish.com/courses/)
- **DDM (Daily Dictation Members)**: 通过观看真实的美国人日常对话、电视节目、新闻等来学习英语，这强调了语言学习的实际应用和真实环境的重要性。启示我们在学习语言时，应尽量接触真实的语言环境，提高实际应用能力。
