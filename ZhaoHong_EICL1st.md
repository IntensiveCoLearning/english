在一个简单的句子里只有一个生词的时候，虽然不认识但是可以根据读音猜出来。
但是当不熟悉的词比较多，句子结构又比较复杂的时候，就有点困难了。
准备使用《新概念III》来作为词汇和语法的补充。
找了两个学习资料：
- [视频教程](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5YAbMpT3Nh0-CzUxXCc79WTHXBwuZ8PN) 外研社的原版教程，虽然有些年头了，但是看起来还是比较舒服的（相比之下新东方在线的课程就太冗长太啰嗦了
- [学习笔记](https://www.ha85.com/books/3) 作为补充，看一下这个学习笔记也是不错的。

另外看了一下教练的网站提供的[课程](https://letsmasterenglish.com/courses/)
- **DDM (Daily Dictation Members)**: 通过观看真实的美国人日常对话、电视节目、新闻等来学习英语，这强调了语言学习的实际应用和真实环境的重要性。启示我们在学习语言时，应尽量接触真实的语言环境，提高实际应用能力。

- **LME Weekly**: 每月包括3个DDM和1个PIRF课程，建议每周学习一课，同时鼓励参加实时互动课程。这提示我们，系统的自学和互动学习相结合，可以更有效地提高语言能力。
- **Action English**: 针对中高级学生，通过讨论当前事件和新闻来学习使用合适的词汇和表达。这提示我们，语言学习不仅要注重基础知识，还要通过时事和实际话题的讨论，来提高表达的准确性和自信心。
- **文化背景、习语和短语动词**: 课程中涵盖了文化背景、习语和短语动词的学习。这提示我们，语言学习不仅是学习语法和词汇，还需要理解文化背景和习语，以便更好地理解和使用语言。

这些课程设置强调了多方面的英语学习方法，包括实际应用、基础技能、系统学习、互动学习、进阶讨论和文化理解。这提示我们，在学习英语时，应该采取多种方法，注重实用性和全面性，才能更有效地掌握和应用英语。
