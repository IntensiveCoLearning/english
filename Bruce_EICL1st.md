# Bruce Xu

Hi guys, I'm Bruce, co-initiator of LXDAO and ETHPanda. I live oversea, but I work remotely and mainly in Chinese communities, so my English skills are degenerating, therefore, I would like to co-learn with you guys to practice more.

I'm also preparing to join EDCON and other ETH global events, so English is very important for me.

## Do you think you will finish the whole CoLearning program?

Yes 100%
