# $PENY
Hi, guys. I'm Penny, my nickname on 𝕏 is [@Penny777](https://x.com/Penny777_eth). Please follow me! Currently, I'm living in New Zealand and working for a Web3 company. 
It may sound like I have a lot of opportunities to learn English with native speakers, but that's not true. All of my colleagues are also Chinese, and we speak Chinese all day. The local people have a Kiwi accent, which is very difficult to understand—HELL MODE! So, I want to join this group and dive into English training together.

## Do you think you will finish the whole CoLearning program?
To be honest, I'm not very sure, maybe 50%
