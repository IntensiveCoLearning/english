What I heard: 
伊万卡 特朗普演讲

Real change the kind we haven't seen in decades is only going to come from outside the system, and going to come from a man who has spent his entire life doing what others said could not be done. My father is a fighter. when priimaries got tough and they were tough.he did what any great leader does. He dug deeper, worked harder get better and became stronger. i haven seen him fighting for her family. I haven seen him fighting for his employees. I haven seen him fighting for his company. and now i am seeing him fighting for his country. 

One year ago, I introduced my father when he declared his candidacy in his own way and through his own sheer force of will. He sacrificed greatly to enter the political arena as an outsider and he prevailed against a field of 16 very telented competitors. For more than one year, Donald Trump has been the people's champion and tonitht he is the peoples nominee.

What I heard: 
Astronomers regularly track the trajectories of asteroids to ensure that none of them are on a potential collision course with our planet.

While neither of the recent asteroids whizzed by at a concerning distance, the space rocks can yield valuable information that NASA uses to prepare for any potential future collision scenarios.

Asteroids, which are remnants left over from the formation of the solar system, are also of interest because capturing details about their size, orbit and composition can reveal insights about our corner of the cosmos.

### 2024.7.7
What I heard: 
Voters are turning out in high numbers across France to vote in the second round of a snap election called by President Emmanuel Macron, who risks losing swaths of his centrist allies in parliament and being forced to see out the remaining three years of his presidential term in an awkward partnership with the far right.

According to data published by the French Interior Ministry, 26.63% of French voters cast their vote by noon Sunday (6 a.m. ET) - a level unseen since 1981.

After taking the lead in the first round of voting last Sunday, the far-right National Rally (RN) – led by the 28-year-old Jordan Bardella under the watchful eye of party doyenne Marine Le Pen – is closer to power than ever before.

### 2024.7.8

### 2024.7.9
What I heard: 

China’s BYD, which vies with Tesla for the title of the world’s top maker of battery electric vehicles, has agreed to build a $1 billion car factory in Turkey, the Turkish government has announced.

BYD’s CEO Wang Chuanfu and Turkey’s Industry and Technology Minister Mehmet Fatih Kaci signed the agreement in Istanbul, according to a statement from the Turkish ministry Monday. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan attended the signing ceremony, it said.

“We aim to meet the growing demand for new-energy vehicles in the region and reach consumers in Europe,” the statement cited BYD representatives as saying.

The announcement came just days after provisional additional duties on imports of Chinese-made EVs into the European Union came into effect. The tariffs, ranging from 17.4% to 37.6%, are aimed at stopping a flood of cheap Chinese cars built with what the EU deems unfair support from the government.

Turkey is in a customs union with the EU. That means vehicles can be exported from the country to the trading bloc tariff-free.

According to the agreement with Turkey, BYD will invest about $1 billion in the factory, which will be able to produce 150,000 electric and hybrid vehicles annually, and set up a research and development center for sustainable mobility technologies at the plant.

The factory is expected to start production at the end of 2026 and provide as many as 5,000 jobs in the country.
CNN has reached out to BYD for comment but hasn’t received a response.

The EU’s decision earlier this year imposed an extra 17.4% tariff on the vehicles BYD ships from China to the bloc, which also has a standard 10% duty on all car imports.

Talks between the EU and China are expected to continue but, if no agreement is reached, the additional tariffs will become definitive in November.

BYD already announced in December that it would build an EV factory in EU member Hungary, becoming the first major Chinese automaker to build passenger cars in Europe.

### 2024.7.10
Arson at warehouses linked to arms for Ukraine. Surveillance cameras where NATO trains Ukrainian troops. Blunt vandalism of ministerial cars. Even an apparent, failed bomb plot.

Russia has been engaged in a “bold” sabotage operation across NATO’s member states for more than six months, targeting the supply lines of weapons for Ukraine and the decision-makers behind it, according to a senior NATO official.

Multiple security officials across Europe describe a threat that is metastasizing as Russian agents, increasingly under scrutiny by security services and frustrated in their own operations, hire local amateurs to undertake high-risk, and often deniable, crimes on their behalf.


The NATO official said they had observed “an unprecedented escalation and spread of Russia’s hybrid warfare” over the past six months, which included “physical sabotage” on the supply line of NATO weapons intended for Ukraine. “It is everything from point of production and origin, to storage, to those who are making decisions, to the actual delivery,” the senior NATO official said. “It is bold. Russia is attempting to intimidate (our) allies.”
