伊万卡 特朗普演讲

Real change the kind we haven't seen in decades is only going to come from outside the system, and going to come from a man who has spent his entire life doing what others said could not be done. My father is a fighter. when priimaries got tough and they were tough.he did what any great leader does. He dug deeper, worked harder get better and became stronger. i haven seen him fighting for her family. I haven seen him fighting for his employees. I haven seen him fighting for his company. and now i am seeing him fighting for his country. 

One year ago, I introduced my father when he declared his candidacy in his own way and through his own sheer force of will. He sacrificed greatly to enter the political arena as an outsider and he prevailed against a field of 16 very telented competitors. For more than one year, Donald Trump has been the people's champion and tonitht he is the peoples nominee.

What I heard: 
Astronomers regularly track the trajectories of asteroids to ensure that none of them are on a potential collision course with our planet.

While neither of the recent asteroids whizzed by at a concerning distance, the space rocks can yield valuable information that NASA uses to prepare for any potential future collision scenarios.

Asteroids, which are remnants left over from the formation of the solar system, are also of interest because capturing details about their size, orbit and composition can reveal insights about our corner of the cosmos.

What I heard: 
Voters are turning out in high numbers across France to vote in the second round of a snap election called by President Emmanuel Macron, who risks losing swaths of his centrist allies in parliament and being forced to see out the remaining three years of his presidential term in an awkward partnership with the far right.

According to data published by the French Interior Ministry, 26.63% of French voters cast their vote by noon Sunday (6 a.m. ET) - a level unseen since 1981.

After taking the lead in the first round of voting last Sunday, the far-right National Rally (RN) – led by the 28-year-old Jordan Bardella under the watchful eye of party doyenne Marine Le Pen – is closer to power than ever before.

### 2024.7.9
What I heard: 

China’s BYD, which vies with Tesla for the title of the world’s top maker of battery electric vehicles, has agreed to build a $1 billion car factory in Turkey, the Turkish government has announced.

BYD’s CEO Wang Chuanfu and Turkey’s Industry and Technology Minister Mehmet Fatih Kaci signed the agreement in Istanbul, according to a statement from the Turkish ministry Monday. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan attended the signing ceremony, it said.

“We aim to meet the growing demand for new-energy vehicles in the region and reach consumers in Europe,” the statement cited BYD representatives as saying.

The announcement came just days after provisional additional duties on imports of Chinese-made EVs into the European Union came into effect. The tariffs, ranging from 17.4% to 37.6%, are aimed at stopping a flood of cheap Chinese cars built with what the EU deems unfair support from the government.

Turkey is in a customs union with the EU. That means vehicles can be exported from the country to the trading bloc tariff-free.

According to the agreement with Turkey, BYD will invest about $1 billion in the factory, which will be able to produce 150,000 electric and hybrid vehicles annually, and set up a research and development center for sustainable mobility technologies at the plant.

The factory is expected to start production at the end of 2026 and provide as many as 5,000 jobs in the country.
CNN has reached out to BYD for comment but hasn’t received a response.

The EU’s decision earlier this year imposed an extra 17.4% tariff on the vehicles BYD ships from China to the bloc, which also has a standard 10% duty on all car imports.

Talks between the EU and China are expected to continue but, if no agreement is reached, the additional tariffs will become definitive in November.

BYD already announced in December that it would build an EV factory in EU member Hungary, becoming the first major Chinese automaker to build passenger cars in Europe.

Arson at warehouses linked to arms for Ukraine. Surveillance cameras where NATO trains Ukrainian troops. Blunt vandalism of ministerial cars. Even an apparent, failed bomb plot.

Russia has been engaged in a “bold” sabotage operation across NATO’s member states for more than six months, targeting the supply lines of weapons for Ukraine and the decision-makers behind it, according to a senior NATO official.

Multiple security officials across Europe describe a threat that is metastasizing as Russian agents, increasingly under scrutiny by security services and frustrated in their own operations, hire local amateurs to undertake high-risk, and often deniable, crimes on their behalf.


The NATO official said they had observed “an unprecedented escalation and spread of Russia’s hybrid warfare” over the past six months, which included “physical sabotage” on the supply line of NATO weapons intended for Ukraine. “It is everything from point of production and origin, to storage, to those who are making decisions, to the actual delivery,” the senior NATO official said. “It is bold. Russia is attempting to intimidate (our) allies.”

American Helene Sula vividly remembers the first time she discovered tap water was a different ball game in Europe.

Sula, from Texas, was at a restaurant in Germany. When the server asked for her drink order, Sula requested water.

“They kind of scoffed at me like, ‘You can get water. But why would you?’” Sula recalls.

She remembers glancing around and realizing everyone else in the restaurant was enjoying glasses of wine and pints of beer – no water to be seen.

Sula repeated her water order and the server demurred. But, when the water arrived, it wasn’t the giant glass of free tap water, sloshing with ice, Sula was expecting.

Instead, she was served a single glass liter bottle of sparkling water, accompanied by a tiny drinking glass and 2 Euro price tag.

Sula couldn’t believe it.


“In the US, you sit down at the table and you’re given a huge glass of water with ice and it’s not even a question – it’s just plopped on the table. No matter if you’re at a fancy restaurant or a casual restaurant, you’re going to get a huge free glass of water,” Sula tells CNN Travel.

A few years later, when Sula and her husband relocated to Germany – the couple observed another water-related cultural difference.

Whenever they went out hiking, biking or walking the city, Sula and her husband would pack large water bottles – sometimes even CamelBaks, a type of water backpack (“So we can drink water at every possible moment,” Sula explains).

Meanwhile their European friends often went without water entirely, holding out until they decamped to a bar that evening – and even then, they’d usually opt for wine instead. Sula couldn’t believe it.

“I just figured, maybe Europeans just don’t get as dehydrated as we do,” says Sula, still audibly baffled after several years living in Europe.

Chataverse is an NFT-gated messaging app that enables NFT holders and creators to communicate, socialize, and govern transparently and crypto-natively. Aside from NFT's financial incentive, another main reason for a person to purchase an NFT is to access and engage in its community. While most of these communities are built on Discord, the platform itself has problems such as high vulnerability to being hacked and spammed, bombarded channels that can be irrelevant, and countless bots/plug-ins that are complicated. In order to tackle these problems, Chataverse provides the following solutions: - NFT-gated group chats to prevent scams and spam (100% holders). - Freedom to create and join topic-based messaging groups within an NFT community. (ex. Azuki @ San Francisco, Bored Ape Basketball Club). - Forum-style groups for large communities that allow NFT holders to post, comment, and react. - Built-in NFT community management tools that include voting, airdrops, and event proposals. - On-chain "Chataccount" that can aggregate a user's multiple wallets across multiple chains to avoid the inconvenience of switching between wallets.

Two days after Alec Baldwin’s involuntary manslaughter trial began and nearly three years after the fatal “Rust” movie set shooting that led to the charge against him, a New Mexico judge said eight words that left the actor visibly emotional – and marked the trial’s end.

“Your motion to dismiss with prejudice is granted,” Judge Mary Marlowe Sommer told Baldwin and his legal team in court on Friday afternoon, prompting an already shaking Baldwin to remove his glasses and sob into his hand before embracing his wife, Hilaria.

The ruling concluded nearly three years of back-and-forth legal arguments and turnover in prosecutors leading up to the trial against Baldwin, who faced up to 18 months in prison and a $5,000 fine related to the October 2021 fatal shooting death of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins on the set of the Western film, “Rust.”

At the time of the shooting on October 21, 2021, Baldwin was practicing a “cross draw” – pulling a gun from a holster on the side of his body opposite from his draw hand – with a prop gun at a church on the film’s New Mexico set when it fired a live round, killing Hutchins and injuring “Rust” director Joel Souza.

On Thursday, Baldwin’s defense team filed a motion to dismiss the case stating that the prosecutors concealed evidence “potentially pointing to an external source of the live ammunition (prop supplier Seth Kenney) because the evidence would be favorable to Baldwin,” court documents show.

On Friday, following a chaotic hearing that involved one special prosecutor taking the stand as a witness and another special prosecutor – Erlinda Johnson – resigning from the prosecution team that day, Marlowe Sommer sided with the defense as a result of the evidence issue first brought to light Thursday, and granted the motion to dismiss with prejudice, meaning that the case cannot be brought again.

Special prosecutor Kari Morrissey, who on Friday answered questions under oath from defense attorney Alex Spiro, said she was disappointed by the dismissal.

“I believe that the importance of the evidence was misconstrued by the defense attorneys, but I have to respect the court’s decision,” Morrissey said following court Friday.

Here’s what led to the dismissal in the Baldwin case.
