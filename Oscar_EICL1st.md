**关于 A Programmer's Guide to English 学习**：
- **Why 语言学习：** 1）学习双方都能理解的表达方式和表达思维。2）语言的表达不能通过转换为自己熟悉的语言再转换。
  - e.g 1：英文的思维习惯是从细节到具体，而中文思维习惯是从大到小；
  - e.g 2：在实际交流中，你不能将一段英语翻译成中文，理解了意思再想出中文，再翻译成英文表达出去。

- **How 语言学习：** 三个方法练习参考
  - **扩充预料库**的训练方法，**提炼识别语料的关键信息**比如：多种口音区别、不同词性和时态下不同的发音和重音位置变化、单词的多重含义、同义词及其对比反义词等、俚语衍生词等、固定搭配、名词的单复数形态和动词的各种时态变形及其发音规则。
    - 根据自己的情况建立自己的语料库。
    - 尽量用英文学习，而不借助中文翻译学习。推荐以 [Cambridge Dictionary](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english-chinese-traditional/) 为准。
  - **发音和听力**的训练方法：1）从**音标**入手，正确的发音是正常、准确交流的前提，语料库里的素材必须保证正确，**纠音**是积累正确语料中非常关键的一步；2）**精听和泛听**是扩展听力语料库的重要方法。
    - 可通过 [Google 翻译](https://translate.google.as/?pli=1&sl=auto&tl=zh-CN&text=%0A&op=translate)识别纠音。
    - 可通过 **ChatGPT** 对话交流。
