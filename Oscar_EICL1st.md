回顾+继续听：磨耳朵。生词较多，需多熟悉。

- And, yeah, you, **sorority** girl. Just **in case** you **accidentally** wander into a voting **booth** one day. There are some things you should know. And one of them is there is absolutely no evidence to support the statement that we're the greatest country in the world, We're seventh in **literacy**, 27th in math, 22nd in science, 49th in life **expectancy** , 178th in **infant mortality**. Third in **median household income**. Number 4 in **labor force** , and number 4 in **exports**. We lead the world in only three categories . Number of **incarcerated citizens per capita**. Number of adults who believe angels are real. And **defense spending** where we spend more than the next 26 countries combined. 25 of whom are **allies**. Now, none of this is the fault of a 20-year-old college student. But you **nonetheless** are without a doubt. a member of the worst period generation period ever period.

- So when you ask what makes us the greatest country in the world, I don't know what the fuck you're talking about. Yosemite?

- We sure used to be. we stood up for what was right. We fought for **moral** reasons. We passed laws, **struck down** laws for moral reasons. We **waged** wars on poverty, not poor people. We **sacrificed**. We cared about our neighbors. **We put our money where our mouths were and we never beat our chest**. We built great big things, made **ungodly** technological advances. Explored the universe, cured diseases. And we **cultivated** the world's greatest artists and the world's greatest economy. We reached for the stars, acted like men. We **aspired** to intelligence. We didn't **belittle** it. It didn't make us feel **inferior**, We didn't identify ourselves by who we voted for in the last election. and we didn't **scare** so easy.

- Ahem, we were able to be all these things and do all these things because we were informed. By great men, men who were **revered**. The first step in solving any problem, is **recognizing** there is one.America is not the greatest country in the world anymore. Enough?

**Dictation 3 ：** 有点难
- I heard:  There are three things XXX XXX discuss with people, XXXXX politics and the XXX
- he said: There are three things I have learned NEVER to discuss with people, religion, politics and the Great Pumpkin!
- Review: 
  - 没有听出来的名词： religion、 the Great Pumpkin，生词不熟悉，扩充词汇量！；
  - 没有听出来的句子：I have learned NEVER to，说的太快了（连读的这种），这种句型结构欠熟悉

**Dictation 4 ：**

- I heard:  XXX let somebody tell you you can't  do some.
- he said: Don't ever let somebody tell you, you can't do something.
- Review: 
  - 没听出来的词： Don't ever，说的太快了，有连读，多熟悉！
  - 听错的词：something，/sumpn/这样发音第一次知道。

**Dictation 5 ：**

- I heard: I have come here to XXX XXX and kick XX and  all XXX
- he said: I have come here to chew bubblegum and kick ass...and I'm all out of bubblegum!
- Review: 
  - 生词：chew bubblegum，ass 能听清不熟悉这组词
  - 没听出来的词：I'm  out of ，说的太快了....⚠️and I'm 连读 ahm；out of 连读 outta

**小结：**
- 尤其是常见连读的需要注意；
- 生词说明词汇量不够，要多记单词；
- 准备找一个难度系数简单来学习听写，多和日常生活场景相关。

### 2024.6.25

**关于“从 0 开始学习语法”学习：**

- 十大词性熟悉：名词，副词，形容词，动词；代词，数词，感叹词；介词，连词，冠词
- 八大句子成分，拆句子结构：主语、谓语、宾语、定语、状语、补语、同位语、表语

**关于「听写」训练：**

- I heard: 听出什么写什么
- he said: 参考原句进行检查
- Review: why 没有写出原句

**Dictation 1 ：** 哈哈哈，听了十遍

- I heard: XX XX, who received a  XXX  for her work XXX the poor, die in xxx India, she was 87 years old.
- He said: Mother Teresa, who received a Nobel Peace Prize for her work on hehalf of the poor, dies in Calcutta, India. she was 87 years old.
- Review:
  - 没有听出来的名词：
    - Mother Teresa，mother 直接+1 个名字一下子没反应过来
    - Nobel Peace Prize 没听清，熟悉后应该还好
    - Calcutta India 拼写不出来，大概知道是一个地名
  - 没有听出来的短语：on hehalf of 在某人或某个群体的利益或代表性质上行动或做事

**Dictation 2：**  压力小了点

- I heard: Jery what time do you have, i have five o'clock
- he said: Jerry, what time do you have?  I have 5 o'clock
- Review: 
  - 拼写错误：Jery，人名，这个要多熟悉
  - 技巧：通过后面的 i have five o'clock 更加确定前面的听写为 what time do you have，上下文结合。

### 2024.6.24

**关于 A Programmer's Guide to English 学习**：

- **Why 语言学习：** 1）学习双方都能理解的表达方式和表达思维。2）语言的表达不能通过转换为自己熟悉的语言再转换。
  - e.g 1：英文的思维习惯是从细节到具体，而中文思维习惯是从大到小；
  - e.g 2：在实际交流中，你不能将一段英语翻译成中文，理解了意思再想出中文，再翻译成英文表达出去。

- **How 语言学习：** 三个方法练习参考
  - **扩充预料库**的训练方法，**提炼识别语料的关键信息**比如：多种口音区别、不同词性和时态下不同的发音和重音位置变化、单词的多重含义、同义词及其对比反义词等、俚语衍生词等、固定搭配、名词的单复数形态和动词的各种时态变形及其发音规则。
    - 根据自己的情况建立自己的语料库。
    - 尽量用英文学习，而不借助中文翻译学习。推荐以 [Cambridge Dictionary](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english-chinese-traditional/) 为准。
  - **发音和听力**的训练方法：1）从**音标**入手，正确的发音是正常、准确交流的前提，语料库里的素材必须保证正确，**纠音**是积累正确语料中非常关键的一步；2）**精听和泛听**是扩展听力语料库的重要方法。
    - 可通过 [Google 翻译](https://translate.google.as/?pli=1&sl=auto&tl=zh-CN&text=%0A&op=translate)识别纠音。
    - 可通过 **ChatGPT** 对话交流。
  - 通过"**转述**"训练英语思维，听力 -> 转述 -> 说 或者 阅读 -> 转述 -> 写。
- 最后： 不要想走捷径，更多在日常生活场景中的具体 **Practice、Practice and Practice.**

**关于音标发音学习：**

- 指南里「48个音标的标准美式发音」的链接失效了，重新找了一个认为还不错的[美式发音音标学习课程](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV12J411D7W7?p=1&vd_source=45d5e03ab21a5cf7690a0bc34febb58a)。注意训练音标最重要的目的是补充你之前发不出的声音，并且可以辨音。
